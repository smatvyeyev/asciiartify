 I'll help you with a comparative analysis of three tools for deploying Kubernetes clusters in a local environment: minikube, kind, and k3d. We'll also consider the risks associated with Docker licensing and explore the possibility of using an alternative like Podman.

## Comparison table
This table provides a concise overview of each tool, its advantages, and disadvantages. You can use this table for further comparison and decision-making regarding the best tool for your specific use case.
| Tool     | Description                                                                                                 | OS                    | ARCH             | Advantages                                                                                                           | Disadvantages                                                                     |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minikube | Lightweight tool for deploying a single-node Kubernetes cluster on a local machine using a virtual machine. | Linux, macOS, Windows | x86, x86_64, ARM | - Easy to install and use.  - Supports many Kubernetes features.  - Well-suited for local development and testing.   | - Limited scalability to a single node.  - May be limited by computer resources.  |
| Kind     | Tool for creating local Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers as cluster nodes.                       | Linux, macOS, Windows | x86, x86_64, ARM | - Easy to set up and use. - Supports many Kubernetes features. - Enables the deployment of multi-node clusters.      | - Dependency on Docker and its licensing. - May be limited by computer resources. |
| k3d      | Tool for creating local Kubernetes clusters using lightweight K3s implementation within Docker containers.  | Linux, macOS, Windows | x86, x86_64, ARM | - Fast and lightweight. - Requires fewer resources compared to full Kubernetes. - Supports many Kubernetes features. | - Dependency on Docker and its licensing. - May be limited by computer resources. |

## Risks associated with Docker licensing

Docker uses different licenses for its components. The free version of Docker (Community Edition) allows commercial use. However, Docker Enterprise Edition provides additional features and support but requires a paid license. Before using Docker in commercial projects, it's important to review the licensing terms and ensure you're using the appropriate Docker version.

## Alternative to Docker - Podman:
Podman is an alternative to Docker that doesn't require a separate daemon service but maintains a compatible API. It allows running containers without the need for installing and running a Docker daemon. Podman provides an isolated container environment and can be used with Kubernetes deployment tools like minikube, kind, or k3d. Using Podman can help mitigate some of the risks associated with Docker licensing.




## Conclusion
Depending on your specific situation, you can choose one tool or a combination of different tools for deploying Kubernetes clusters in a local environment. It is recommended to conduct your own research and testing to determine which tool best suits your use case.
For you I recomend use K3d tool.
K3d is easy to use, even for beginners. This is important for teams, as they often do not have the time to learn more complex tools.

## Demo k3d cluster run

1)
install k3d:

    wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | TAG=v5.0.0 bash

    k3d version

2)
kreate cluster:

    k3d cluster create demo
    kubectl cluster-info

3)
run demo app:

    kubectl run demo --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4 --port=8080 kubectl get no kubectl get po

4) expose app:

    kubectl port-forward demo 8080:8080&

5) chek resault

    curl localhost:8080

6) delete demo cluster

    k3d  cluster delete demo
